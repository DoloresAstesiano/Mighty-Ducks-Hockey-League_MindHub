                <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li>
                <b>DIMENSIONS.</b>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within 
                a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older. 
                </li>
                <li>
                <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> Fields used within the competition program must be 
                a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in 
                the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                field may be required to play all their games away. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                <b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS </b>

                    <li>
                    U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
